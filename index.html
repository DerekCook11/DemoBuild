What does "third party" mean?</p>
<p>A: A third-party program is a bona fide, independent healthcare-related educational, scientific, business, and/or policymaking conference, meeting, or event put on by a third party other than a company. This term includes programs that are accredited to provide continuing education credits and programs that are not accredited.
A third-party program organizer is an entity that organizes and/or oversees the development of the third-party program, including the selection of presenters, attendees, topics, materials, and methods. A third-party program organizer could include, for example, a healthcare professional society, institution, or association; a medical trust fund, a continuing education provider, or a hospital or other healthcare entity.</p>
What about grants for grand rounds or in-house programs?</p>
<p>A: Cook Medical is only able to provide product training on Cook Medical products.</p>
How long does the review process take?</p>
<p>A: Give us as much time as possible to consider your request. We require that completed applications be received 60 days prior to the start date of the event for the review process. The review process cannot begin until the application is signed by the requestor and all required documents are submitted.</p>
Who do I contact with questions?</p>
<p>A: Contact your regional grants administrator. Do not contact your Cook Medical sales representative.
